	<h1>Types of traffic-related information that can be accessed through TOM TOM APIs:</h1>

	<h2><i>1.Real-time traffic conditions:</i> Traffic data such as congestion, accidents,
	 and construction, which can be used for real-time route optimization and traffic management.</h2>

	<h2><i>2.Historical traffic data:</i> TomTom API provides access to historical traffic 
	data going back up to five years, 
	which can be used for analyzing traffic patterns and predicting future traffic conditions.</h2>

	<h2><i>3.Traffic incident data : </i> APIs provide access to data on traffic incidents such as 
	accidents, road closures, 	
	and weather-related disruptions, which can be used for route planning and incident management.</h2>

	<h2><i>Traffic flow data:</i>APIs provide access to data on traffic flow, such as average speeds, traffic volumes, and congestion levels, 
	which can be used for traffic forecasting and analysis.</h2>

	<h2><i>5.Road network data:</i>APIs provide access to data on road networks, such as road segments, intersections, and traffic signals,
	 which can be used for route planning and analysis.</h2>

	<h2><i>Returns detailed information about traffic jams and traffic related incidents.<br>
	<u>Details include: </u>start-location, end-location, road-name, type of delay, length (in time) of the delay,
	 significance, and distance.</h2></i>
